## Scopes

Scopes are sections in your program that you define your code, 
scopes determine what variables, functions, and classes are accessible, 
by default the program runs in the global scope where everything is 
accessible to the rest of the program.

You are able to define scopes by using the `{` and `}`. For example:
```kotlin
// Global scope
{
    // Defined scope
}
```

Anything that is defined in a scope is only accessible to that scope and any 
scopes inside that scope:
```kotlin
// Global scope
// Anything here is accessible ANYWHERE in the program
// i is in the global scope
i = 10;
{
    print(i); // -> 10
    // j is in a sub scope and cannot be accessed
    // in any parent scope, in this case that would
    // be the global scope
    j = 20;
    {
        print(i); // -> 10
        print(j); // -> 20
        // Both i and j are accessible because this
        // scope has parents with both of these values
    }
}
print(j); 
// This would throw an Error because
// j is not defined in this scope

print(i); // -> 10
```

Assigning variables in scope also works similarly, if a variable is defined 
in the global scope, and you reassign that variable in a scope then the variables 
in the global scope will be modified.
```kotlin
i = 0;
{
    i = 10;
}
{
    i = i - 1;
}
print(i); // -> 9
```
