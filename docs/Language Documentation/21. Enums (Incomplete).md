## Enums

Enums provide a nice way to program constants. This is done by using an enum class which can be declared using the `enum` keyword, much like a regular class enums can have defined methods and fields.

### Syntax

The syntax to declare an enum class is very simple, just the `enum` keyword followed by the enum name, then inside your backets you can define your constants separated by commas:

```kotlin
enum Direction {
	NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST
}
```

These can then just be simply accessed like a static field:

```kotlin
Direction.NORTH;
Direction.EAST;
Direction.SOUTH;
Direction.WEST;
```
