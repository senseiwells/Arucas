## Operators

There are quite a few operators in Arucas but don't worry, most of them are similar to other languages and are easy to pick up!

### `(` and `)` - Brackets

While not necessarily an operator, I think that brackets are an important thing to mention before we talk about the other operators. Similar to what you might have learnt in maths, brackets allow you to change the order of operations. We will cover where brackets may be useful in the following operators.

### `=` - Assignment

We have already covered this operator, the assignment operator, briefly when talking about creating variables, but I will reiterate, this operator allows you to assign a value to a variable:
```kotlin
exampleVariable = "Example string";
```
The assignment operator also has a neat feature that allows you to assign multiple values at the same time using lists:
```kotlin
example1, example2, example3 = [1, 2, 3];
print(example1); // This would print 1
print(example2); // This would print 2
print(example3); // This would print 3
```
This works with any list but the list must be the same size as the number of values you want to assign to:
```kotlin
// This would crash since there is not a match
// with the number of variables and values
example1, example2 = [1, 2, 3];
```

Another thing that is important about assignment is that it will also return the value that was just assigned, for example:
```kotlin
v = 10;
print(v = 12);
// This will print 12 because the assignment
// returns the value that was assigned which was 12
```
A mention about brackets here, the value being assigned will always be evaluated first so for example:
```kotlin
v = 0;
// We will cover the addition operator in the next
// section you might want to read that first then come back
print(v = 10 + 3);
// This will print 13 because v was assigned
// to the value of 13 because 10 + 3 = 13
```
But what if we want to assign a value to a variable, then manipulate that value to print:
```kotlin
v = 0;
// We put the assignment in brackets so it
// happens with out adding the 3 to the 10
print((v = 10) + 3);
// This will print 13 because v was assigned to 10
// and then the assignment returned the value which 
// in this case was 10, then it added 3 to that value
// which equals 13 which was then printed

print(v);
// This will print 10 since we did not assign 13 to v
``` 

### `+` - Addition

This is the addition operator, this allows you to add two things together, usually numbers, but this operator by default also works with strings to concatenate them.
```kotlin
result = 9 + 10;
print(result); 
// This would print 21... I mean 19

print(0.5 + 0.5);
// This would print 1

stringResult = "5" + "6";
print(stringResult);
// This would print 56

print("Hello W" + "orld");
// This would print Hello World 
```

The addition operator can also be used as a unary operator, this means that you can have it on the left side of a value with no other value on the left, like this:
```kotlin
print(+10);
// This would print 10
```
This is pretty redundant, but is to be consistent with the subtraction unary operator.

### `-` - Subtraction

This is the subtraction operator, this allows you to take away one value to another, by default this operator only works with numbers.
```kotlin
someMath = 29 - 8;
print(someMath);
// This would print 21

print(9 - 80);
// This would print -71
```

The subtraction operator can also be used as a unary operator, this allows you to write negative values:
```kotlin
print(-10);
// This would print -10
```
An important thing to note is that the subtraction operator has a low predecence and so it will be applied last, here is an example:
```kotlin
-2 ^ 2; // -> -4, this does 2 ^ 2 then makes it negative

(-2) ^ 2; // -> 4
```

### `*` - Multiplication

This is the multiplication operator, and this allows you to multiply two values together, by default this only works with numbers.
```kotlin
print(5 * 4);
// This would print 20

print(20 * 0.5);
// This would print 10
```

An important thing to note is that multiplication will take precedence over addition and subtraction, here's an example:
```kotlin
3 + 4 * 5; // -> 23
```
If you want addition to take precedence, then you will need to use brackets:
```kotlin
(3 + 4) * 5; // -> 35
```

### `/` - Division

This is the division operator, this allows for dividing of two values, by default this only works with numbers.
```kotlin
print(20 / 2);
// This would print 10

print(3.141 / 500);
// This would print 0.006282
```

Similar to multiplication, division takes precedence over addition and subtraction.

### `^` - Exponent

This is the exponent operator and allows you to raise a base to a power, by default this only works with numbers.
```kotlin
print(2 ^ 5);
// This would print 32

print(25 ^ 0.5);
// This would print 5
```

Exponents take precedence over both addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, here's an example:
```kotlin
5 * 2 ^ 3; // -> 40

(5 * 2) ^ 3; // -> 1000
```

### `++` and `--` - Increment and Decrement

These are the increment and decrement operators, by default these only work on numbers, these are just syntactic sugar for making a value equal to one more or less than its current value:
```kotlin
value = 9;
value++; // value now equals 10
value--; // value now equals 9
```

Using the increment and decrement operators is the exact same as writing:
```kotlin
value = 9;
value = value + 1; // value now equals 10
value = value - 1; // value now equals 9
```

Internally, Arucas compiles the first example into the second example. The increment and decrement are just a shorthand.

### `.` - Dot

The dot operator is used to access and call members of a value, don't worry if you don't know what this means, yet we will cover this in more detail. Every value has members by default, and this is how you can interact with them.
```kotlin
value = "Example string";
value = value.uppercase();
// value now equals "EXAMPLE STRING"
```

### `&&` - AND

This is the and operator, and by default is used between boolean values for boolean logic. Here is and example:
```kotlin
true && true; // -> true
true && false; // -> false
false && true; // -> false
false && false; // -> false
```

The and operator takes two boolean values and will only return `true` if both boolean values are `true` otherwise it will return `false`.

An important feature of this and operator is that it short circuits. Now to explain this you need to understand that the expressions are evaluated one at a time, and it goes from left to right. If the left expression of the and operator is `false` then it knows that no matter whether the right-hand side is `true` or `false` it will always return `false` so it skips evaluating the right-hand side.

If you want to use an and operator that evaluates both sides you can use the bitwise and operator `&`, we will go over this later.

### `||` - OR

This is the or operator, and by default is used between boolean values for boolean logic. Here is an example:
```kotlin
true || true; // -> true
true || false; // -> true
false || true; // -> true
false || false; // -> false
```
The or operator takes two booleans and will only return `true` if at least one of the boolean values is `true`, otherwise it will return `false`.

Similarly to the and operator, this will short circuit, if the left-hand side evaluates to `true` then it will always return `true` so it skips evaluating the right-hand side.

If you want to use an or operator that evaluates both sides you can use the bitwise or operator `|`, we will again go over this later.

### `~` - XOR

This is the exclusive or operator and can be used with booleans (as well as numbers, but will cover this later) by default. Here is an example:
```kotlin
true ~ true; // -> false
true ~ false; // -> true
false ~ true; // -> true
false ~ false; // -> false
```
This exclusive or operator takes two boolean and will only return `true` if the boolean values are different from each other, in this case one must always be `true`, and one must always be `false` for it to return `true`.

This operator does not short circuit since it always needs to check both left and right-hand side, this is the same operator that is used for the bitwise XOR, we will go over this later.

### `!` - NOT

This is the not operator and by default only can be used for booleans, this inverts the boolean, here is an example:
```kotlin
!true; // -> false
!false; // -> true
```
This takes the boolean and returns the opposite boolean value, unlike the other operators shown this a unary only operator, meaning it only has a value on the right-hand side and not the left.

### `==` - Equals

This is the equals operator and can be used between any values, it checks whether two values are equal.
```kotlin
true == false; // -> false
"string" == "string"; // -> true

num = 10;
num == 10; // -> true
```
This is often useful for doing `null` checks, the safest way to do a null check is the following:
```kotlin
example = null;
example = "";
null == example; // -> false
```

### `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` - Comparison

These are the comparison operators that can be used to see whether values are greater than, less than, greater than or equal, or less than or equal. Be default, this only works with numbers.
```kotlin
9 > 5; // -> true
9 < 5; // -> false
5 >= 5; // -> true
6.5 <= 6.2; // -> false 
```

### `&` - Bitwise AND

This is the bitwise and operator, this works on both booleans and numbers. On booleans it acts similar to the `&&` operator but does not short circuit. On numbers, it compares the bits, here is an example of `420 & 255`
```
110100100 <- 420
011111111 <- 255
--------- &
010100100 <- 164
```
It compares the bits in each position with each other and will only return 1 if both bits in both numbers are 1 in that position.

### `|` - Bitwise OR

This is the bitwise or operator, this works on both booleans and numbers. On booleans it acts similar to the `|` operator but does not short circuit. On numbers, it compares the bits, here is an example of `240 | 14`
```
11110000 <- 240
00001110 <- 14
-------- |
11111110 <- 254
```
It compares the bits in each position with each other and will return 1 if either of the bits at that position is 1.

### `~` - Bitwise XOR

This is the bitwise exclusive or operator, this is the same operator that is used for the boolean XOR previously mentioned, but this can also be used to manipulate bits. Here is an example: `165 ~ 170`
```
10100101 <- 165
10101010 <- 170
-------- ~
00001111 <- 15
```
It compares the bits in each position with eachother and will only return 1 if only 1 of the bits is 1 and the other is 0.

### `>>` and `<<` - Bit shift right and Bit shift left

These are the bit shifting operators, these by default only work on numbers, they work by taking the bits of the number and shifting them left or right by a certain amount.
```kt
255 >> 2; // 11111111 -> 00111111 = 63
64 << 1; // 0100000 -> 10000000 = 128
```
