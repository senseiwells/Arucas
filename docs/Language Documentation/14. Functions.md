## Functions

Functions are a great abstraction that we use to hide complexity and easily reuse code, functions allow you to write code that can be executed from elsewhere in your program by referencing the function's name, or identifier. 

### Simple Functions

Functions in Arucas are defined with the `fun` keyword followed by an identifier then brackets which contain your parameters for the function we will cover this more in a moment, then it is followed by some statements in a scope, here is an example:
```kotlin
fun exampleFunction() {
    print("Function was called");
}

// To call a function we use the name of the
// function then brackets to call it
// similar to how we use the print function
exampleFunction(); // prints "Function was called"
```

Now, if we wanted to add some parameters:
```kotlin
// The parameter is a variable that you can
// use inside of your function, in this case
// we take in a name then use it to print a statement
fun anotherFunction(name) {
    print("Your name is " + name + "!");
}

// To call the function with a parameter we 
// just need to do the same as before but
// include what we want to pass into the function
// as the name variable
anotherFunction("sensei"); // prints "Your name is sensei!"
```

You can add more parameters by adding commas and listing all the parameters you wish to take in:
```kotlin
// Parameter names must be different
// so you can differentiate between them in the function
fun moreFunction(number1, number2) {
    // We take both numbers and print the sum of them
    print(number1 + number2);
}

// To call the function we put the parameters
// we want to pass in separated by commas in the
// same order that the function has them
// in this case number1 = 9, number2 = 10
moreFunction(9, 10); // prints 19
```

### Variable Parameters

You are also able to take in a variable amount of parameters, this means that you can call the function with as many parameters as you want, and it is passed into the function as a list. To do this, we define the parameter in the function followed by `...`. 
```kotlin
// The numbers parameter is always a list
// filled in with the parameters
variableParameters(numbers...) {
    total = 0;
    // Since numbers is a list we can iterate
    // over it using a foreach loop
    foreach (num : numbers) {
        total = total + num;
    }
    // This function adds up all the given numbers
    // and then outputs the total
    print(total);
}

variableParameters(1, 2, 3, 4, 9); // prints 19
// numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 9]

variableParameters(); // prints 0
// numbers = []

variableParameters(-9); // prints -9
// numbers = [-9]
```

Another important thing to know is that functions are first class objects, meaning that they are treated just like any other value. So you can store functions in variables and pass functions into other functions, which allows you to write more flexible code.
```kotlin
fun exampleFunction() {
    print("Example function was called!");
}

// We don't call the function just reference it by it's name
// so exampleFunction not exampleFunction()
variable = exampleFunction;

// Now since variable stores the exampleFunction function
// we can actually call variable as if it were a function
variable(); // prints "Example function was called!"
```

### Lambdas

You are also able to create anonymous functions or more frequently called lambdas, these functions can be defined on the go and cannot be called like normal functions since they do not exist with a name, but you can still call them through a variable like previously shown, you can define an anonymous function with the `fun` keyword and skipping the identifier and then brackets with the parameters followed by your statements in a scope.
```kotlin
lambda = fun() {
    print("This is a lambda");
};
lambda(); // prints "This is a lambda"
```

Here is a use when you need to pass a function into another function:
```kotlin
fun runFunctionWithDelay(delay, function) {
    // This pauses the program for an amount of milliseconds
    sleep(delay);
    // This calls the function
    function();
}

// In this case our lambda cannot have parameters
// because runFunctionWithDelay doesn't pass in any parameters
runFunctionWithDelay(100, fun() {
    print("Printed after 100 milliseconds");
});
```

### Return Statements

Functions have the ability to return values, functions technically always return values in fact, similar to how the `input` function works which we looked at earlier that returns whatever the user inputted into the console. Return statements can be used inside of functions to return a value, you can do this by using the `return` keyword followed by a value, or alternatively if you don't want to return a value you can just leave it blank, if you leave it blank then the function will by default just return `null`, then follow that by a semicolon:
```kotlin
fun biggerThanFive(num) {
    if (num > 5) {
        return "Bigger than 5";
    }
    return "Smaller than 5";
}

// We need to assign the return value to something
biggerThan5 = biggerThanFive(20); // -> "Bigger than 5"

print(biggerThan5); // prints "Bigger than 5"

// We can also ignore the return value if we don't want it
biggerThanFive(4);
// In this case ignoring the return value is pointless but
// this may be the case of other functions that run code
```

Here is an example where `return` is used to escape a function to stop its execution, return does not always need to return a value and this is a very common use case which can reduce your indentation level which can make your code cleaner and easier to read overall. 
```kotlin
fun printNameIfOver18(name, age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        // Under 18 so we don't want to
        // execute any more of this function
        // so we just return out of the function
        return;
    }
    print(name);
}

// Another way of writing the previous function
fun printNameIfOver18(name, age) {
    // In this case the indentation doesn't matter
    // but when you have long chains it can make a 
    // big difference and so you might want to return
    if (age >= 18) {
        print(name);
    }
}
```

### Function Scoping

Functions capture variables in the previous scopes to be able to use them in the scope, this lets you use variables from previous scopes:
```kotlin
{
    // Inner scope
    inner = "Random String";
    fun doSomething() {
        print(inner);
    }
    
    doSomething();
}
```

However, functions also have a special property where since they capture the whole previous scope that can access variables that are not yet defined:
```kotlin
{
    fun doSomething() {
        // Technically this variable doesn't exist yet
        print(postFunctionVariable);
    }

    // Now it exists
    postFunctionVariable = 10;

    // Now we call the function
    doSomething();
}
```

However, if you call the function before you define the variable the program will throw an error:
```kotlin
{
    fun doSomething() {
        // Technically this variable doesn't exist yet
        print(postFunctionVariable);
    }

    // Now we call the function
    doSomething();
    // This will crash because postFunctionVariable is not defined yet!

    // Now it exists
    postFunctionVariable = 10;
}
```

Here is an example that may seem confusing at first, but understanding how scoping of functions works helps:
```kotlin
fun generatePrintFunction(stringToPrint) {
    function = fun() {
        // The stringToPrint variable is captured here
        // and saved for later in this function
        print(stringToPrint);
    };
    return function;
}

printFunction = generatePrintFunction("FOO");
// printFunction now contains a lambda that prints a string
// the lambda has the variable "FOO" saved in it that it will use
// when we call the printFunction

printFunction(); // prints "FOO"
```

Another example where the variable changed between function calls:
```kotlin
variable = 10;

fun printSomething() {
	print(variable);
}

printSomething(); // prints 10

variable = 20;
printSomething(); // prints 20
```

### Overloading Functions

Overloading functions is the ability to have functions that have a different number of parameters defined separately and not interfere with each other, overloading functions are possible inside of classes which we will cover later, but defining functions in the scope you cannot overload them, one will simply overwrite the other. This may be possible at a later date, at which point this section of the documentation will be updated.

Here is an example:
```kotlin
fun exampleFunction() {
    print("ExampleFunction");
}

exampleFunction(); // prints "ExampleFunction"

// Define another function with name exampleFunction
// with different amount of parameters
fun exampleFunction(parameter) {
    print("ExampleFunctionWithParam");
}

exampleFunction(null); // prints "ExampleFunctionWithParam"

exampleFunction(); // throws an error since original function was overwritten
```  

This however is not the case with built-in functions, since they are implemented internally they work slightly different and as such they can be overloaded, all information on built in overloads will be documented separately, see the next section on Built-In Functions.

### Delegating Functions

Delegating a function is when instead of calling the function you use it as if it were an object and store the action function as a value much like a lambda:
```kotlin
fun delegateExample() {
	print("called");
}

del = delegateExample; // We didn't call the function
// Since 'del' now has a function stored in it we can call it
del(); // prints 'called'
```

Previously, before Arucas 2.0.0 you could not delegate a function that was overloaded however in Arucas 2.0.0+ we can now do that too.
```kotlin
fun overload() {
	print("0");
}

fun overload(arg) {
	print("1");
}

fun overload(arg1, arg2) {
	print("2");
}

delegate = overload;
// Delegate does not store the 'overload' function but
// instead stores the information to be able to call
// the 'overload' function at a later point

// This means we can do this:
delegate(); // prints '0'
delegate(0); // prints '1'
delegate(0, 0); // prints '2'

// However if you give incorrect number of args:
delegate(0, 0, 0); // Error
```

### Built-In Functions

Throughout this documentation I have been using built-in functions, these functions are implemented natively in the language that allow you to do the basic functions, some examples that I have been using are `print`, `input`, and `sleep`.
There is a list of these basic functions and these provide some key functionality to the language, so you should review them, and they can be found on the separate page [here](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas/blob/main/docs/Built-in%20Extensions.md).
