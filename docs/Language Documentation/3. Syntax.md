# Language Syntax

This section has a quick rundown of all the syntax that the language has, like a cheat sheet. You may want to refer back to this section after reading other sections.

## Literals

Arucas provides 6 object types that you are able to create with literals, these are:

`Number` - An object containing a floating point number, represented by a number

`String` - An object containing an array of characters, represented by any text within two double or single quote marks

`Boolean` - An object containing only one of two possible values, represented by `true` or `false` 

`List` - An object containing a list of other objects, represented by having object separated with comma's within square brackets

`Map` - An object containing a list of key and value pairs of objects, represented by having a list of pairs of objects separated by colons within curly brackets

`Null` - An object representing nothing, represented by `null`

## Basic Operators:

`=` - This assigns a value to a variable

`+` - This adds two numbers together or concatenates two strings

`-` - This subtracts one number from another

`*` - This multiplies one number from another

`/` - This divides one number by another

`^` - This multiplies one number by itself a number of times

`++` - This increments the value of a number by one

`--` - This decrements the value of a number by one

`.` - This allows you to access members of a value

## Logical Operators:

`&&` - This is the logical AND

`||` - This is the logical OR

`!` - This is the logical NOT

`~` - This is the logical XOR

`==` - This evaluates whether two objects are equal

`>` - This evaluates whether a number is more than another

`<` - This evaluates whether a number is less than another

`>=` - This evaluates whether a number is greater than or equal to another

`<=` - This evaluates whether a number is less than or equal to another

One thing to note for AND and OR is that the left side will always be evaluated first, and if it does not evaluate to `true` in the case of AND, or `false` in the case of OR, the right side will not be evaluated.

Another thing to note is that custom classes are able to override some of these operators, changing their functionality, more information will be on this in the classes section.

## Bitwise Operators:

`&` - This is the bitwise AND

`|` - This is the bitwise OR

`~` - This is the bitwise XOR

`>>` - Right bit shift

`<<` - Left bit shift

One thing to note is that the bitwise AND and OR also work for Booleans, however they do not short circuit, so in the case of AND if the left side was evaluated to `false` it would still evaluate the left side, and similarly OR will evaluate the right side even if the left was already `true`.

## Comments:

You are able to make comments in your code that the compiler will ignore.

`//` - Used to comment until a line break

`/* */` - Used for multi-line comments

## Keywords:


### `{` and `}` 

- These are used to define scopes, or code blocks
- Scopes can contain multiple lines of code inside then and usually is indented to visually show it's in a different scope. Any variables initialized inside a scope cannot be accessed outside that scope, but variables defined outside the scope can be accessed and assigned inside that scope, scopes can be used independently as well as with other statements.

Example:
```kotlin
outside = 9;
{
    // variable only defined inside this scope
    inside = 10;
    // variable defined outside of the scope can be assigned and accessed
    outside = outside - 2;
}
// this would crash as 'inside' doesn't exist outside the scope
outside = inside;
```

### `fun` 

- This is used for defining functions
- Functions can have parameters, however functions outside of classes cannot be overloaded, overloaded functions can not be delegated. Functions are called by having their name followed by two brackets.

Examples:
```kotlin
fun doSomething() {
    print("something");
}

fun doSomethingElse(foo) {
    print(foo);
}

doSomething();
```

A thing to note is that the language is not fussy with how you format your code, in terms of new lines and spaces. So formatting like this is considered valid:

```kotlin
fun doSomething()
{
    if (true) print("");
}
```

### `return` 

- This is for escaping out of a function or file
- You are able to return a value, however this is not required. If there is no return statement in a function it will automatically return `null`, you can also return a value out of a file.

Examples:
```kotlin
fun doSomething() {
    return "something";
}

return doSomething();
```

### `if`, `else if`, and `else` 

- These are for evaluating boolean expressions
- You cannot have `else if`s and `else` without an `if`, if one of these has an expression evaluates to true the code inside their code block will be executed, and the rest will be ignored.

Examples:
```kotlin
if (false) { 
    print("foo"); 
} 
else if (false) { 
    print("bar"); 
} 
else { 
    print("baz"); 
}
```

### `switch`, `case`, and `default` 

- These are for matching values
- Switch statements can compare a value to both literals and other expressions, similar to an if statement, you cannot have two of the same literal in the cases and the switch statement is evaluated from first case down to last case with literals being the first thing that is checked in each case. If the value does not match any cases, it will run the default branch. You cannot have more than one default branch.

Example:
```kotlin
fun getNum() {
    return 1;
}

number = 1;
switch (number) {
    // Even though getNum comes before 1 the value
    // will check against literals first, so in this
    // case getNum will ne
    case getNum(), 1, 2, 3 -> {
        print("low");
    }
    case 4, 5 -> { }
    case 6 -> {
        print("highest");
    }
    default -> {
        print("unkown");
    }
}
```

### `while` 

- This is for creating a simple loop
- `while` evaluates a boolean expression similar to `if`, and if it evaluates to `true` then it will execute the code inside, and then go back to the top and repeat the process until it evaluates to `false`.

Examples:
```kotlin
while (true) {
    print("This is an infinite loop");
}

i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    print(i);
    i++;
}
```

### `for` 

- This is for creating an iteration loop
- `for` takes in three expressions, the first will only be executed once at the start, the second is similar to the condition in a while loop, and the third gets executed every time the `for` loop completes.

Example:
```kotlin
/* 
 * This example is exactly the same as the previous 
 * while loop example, just more consise
 */
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i);
}

list = [4, 5, 2, 7];
for (i = 0; i < len(list); i++) {
    value = list.get(i);
    print(value);
}
```

### `foreach` 

- This is for iterating over the values in a list
- `foreach` this is similar to the Java enhanced for loop, you have an identifier which will hold your value and the desired list that you want to iterate over.

Example:
```kotlin
// this does the same as the previous for loop example, just more consise
list = [4, 5, 2, 7];
for (value : list) {
    print(value);
}
```

### `continue` 

- This allows you to return to the top of a loop

Example:
```kotlin
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    print(i);
}
```

### `break` 

- This allows you to escape a loop or case statement

Examples:
```kotlin
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    print(i);
}

number = 18;
switch ("foo") {
    case "bar", "baz" -> {
        print("b");
    } 
    case "foo", "faz" -> {
        if (number >= 18) {
            break;
        }
        print("f");
    }
}
```

### `throw`

- This keyword is used to throw an error
- You can only throw `Error`s, you can construct an `Error` by using the `Error` class, if these go uncaught they will crash the program.

Example:
```kotlin
throw new Error("Something went wrong!", 540);
```

### `try` and `catch` 

- These are used to handle exceptions
- `catch` can only catch `Error`s, the caught value will be of type `Error` which encapsulates the error message and possibly a value. If errors go uncaught, they will crash the program.

Example:
```kotlin
try {
    throw null;
}
catch (error) {
    print(error);
}
```

### `class` 

- This is used to define a `class`
- Classes allow for encapsulation, wrapping other objects (values) into a single object, this class defines that single object and what that object is able to do. 
- If a class has no constructors, you will be able to construct that class with no parameters. Classes also allow you to define methods, or class functions.  You can overload constructors, and methods in a class by differing the number of parameters.
- You can initialize the class members in the constructor, or initialize them when you define them. If you do not define them, they will default to being `null`.

Example:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var other1;
    var other2 = 10;

    Example() { }

    Example(param) {
        this.other1 = param;
    }
}
```

### `var` 

- This is used for declaring variables inside classes
- The var keyword can be used for `static` and non-`static` variables.
- These variables you define can be access using the `.` operator

Examples:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var pi = 3.14;
    var name = "sensei";
}
```

### `.` 

- This is used to access members of an object
- This can be used on `class` names for `static` members or on an object for the object members.

Example:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var number = 10;
    
    // If there is no constructor
    // Arucas generates a synthetic one

    fun printNumber() {
        print(this.number);
    }
}

// We are able to construct it with no parameters
example = new Example();

// these two do the same thing
print(example.number);
example.printNumber();
```

### `this` 

- This is used for referring to itself inside a class
- `this` is passed in internally, and you will have access to it inside a class constructor, method, or operator method, `this` allows you to refer to all the members inside your class, you can assign, access, or call them.

Example:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var number = 10;

    fun setNumber(newNumber) {
        this.number = newNumber;
    }

    fun resetNumber() {
        this.number = 10;
    }
}

e = new Example();
// When we call a method on a value
// it internally passes itself as a parameter
// so you could think of it as resetNumber(e)
// where inside the resetNumber function
// e is referenced with the this keyword
e.resetNumber();
``` 

### `new` 

- This is used to construct a new object
- This is used for custom classes, as the built-in objects cannot be constructed, as they have literals. This will return a new instance of that object.

Examples:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var number = 10;
    
    // We have multiple constructors
    Example() { }
    
    Example(number) {
        this.number = number;
    }
}

// Construction
defaultExample = new Example();
myExample = new Example(20);
```

### `operator` 

- This allows you to override operator methods for an object
- An important thing to note about this is that it will be the left side's operator method that will get used, for example `a + b` would result in `a`'s plus the operator getting called not `b`'s. Whereas `b + a` would result in `b`'s plus operator getting called not `a`'s
- The operators that you can override are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!`

Examples:
```kotlin
class Example {
    var number = 10;

    operator + (other) {
        return this.number + other;
    }

    operator ! () {
        return this.number * -1;
    }

    operator == (other) {
        return this.number == other;
    }
}

// Constructing the class using the new keyword
example = new Example();

plusExample = example + 10; // this would return 20
notExample = !example; // this would return -10
equalsExample = example == 10; // this would return true

// this would throw an error, because 10's operator is being called not example's
errorExample = 10 + example; 
``` 

### `static` 

- This lets you define `static` members, methods, and initializers in a class
- `static` members and methods can be access without an instance of the class. And a `static` initializer will run when the class is evaluated, `static` methods can be overloaded. `static` members are access by typing the `class` name followed by a `.` and then the member name.

Example:
```kotlin
class Example {
    static var number = 10;

    static {
        print("Example class was loaded");
    }

    static fun print() {
        print(Example.number);
    }

    static fun print(prefix) {
        print("%s %s".formatted(prefix, Example.number)); 
    }
}
```

`enum`

- Enums are somewhat similar to classes, but they cannot be constructed and instead have static-like variables of the type that cannot be modified. Enums are great if you want constants that can also encapsulate other values.

Example:
```kotlin
// Every enum by default has 2 static functions
// Direction.values() and Direction.fromString(str)
// they get all the values of the enum and convert
// a string to a enum by name respectively. 
enum Direction {
    NORTH("North"),
    // You can have brackets if you want
    SOUTH(),
    // Or not
    EAST,
    WEST("Wow");

    Direction() {
        // All enum values by default have
        // 2 methods, getName and ordinal
        // getting the name of the enum and the
        // index of the enum respectively
        this.prettyName = this.getName();
    }
    
    /* Constructors are used when initialising
     * the enum values, they can take any values
     */
    Direction(prettyName) {
        this.prettyName = prettyName;
    }

    /* Not a good way to do this, should have
     * opposite as a member variable but this is
     * just an example.
     */
    fun getOpposite() {
        switch(this) {
            case Direction.NORTH -> return Direction.SOUTH;
            case Direction.SOUTH -> return Direction.NORTH;
            case Direction.EAST -> return Direction.WEST;
            case Direction.WEST -> return Direction.EAST;
        }
    }
}

// Direction.NORTH = "Random Value!"; <-- This would crash
// direction = new Direction(); <-- This would also crash
print(Direction.NORTH.getOpposite());
```

`import` and `from`

- These keywords allow you to import classes from other files.
- Currently, cyclical imports are not supported, but usually you don't need two files importing each other.

```kotlin
// Imports all classes from util.Internal file
import * from util.Internal;
// Only imports Collector class from util.Collection
import Collector from util.Collection;
// If you want to import your own file you must have it
// inside your libraries folder, in Vanilla arucas this
// is Users/user/.arucas/libs/

// Since we are importing the Collector class we can not use it
collector = Collector.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
list = collector.filter(fun(value) { return value > 4; }).toList();
print(list);
```
