## Java Integration

If there are specific things you want to achieve that aren't possible with the base language, you may want to look into calling Java code from within your script. This is possibly by using the `util.Internal` library and importing the `Java` class.
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;
``` 

### Java Types

There are many static methods for the Java class, and these will be key for creating Java typed values. One such method is `valueOf`, this converts any Arucas typed value into a Java one:
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

jString = Java.valueOf(""); // Arucas String type -> Java String type
```

All Java typed values have the Arucas type of `Java` and they all have some basic methods you can use, these allow you to access their methods and fields which we will explore later in this documentation. Another method which is important is the `toArucas` method, which tries to convert the Java typed value back into an Arucas typed value.
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

jString = Java.valueOf(""); // Java String type

string = jString.toArucas(); // Back to Arucas String type
``` 

Not every Java type has a conversion and so if you try to convert a Java type that does not have a conversion it will simply just return itself.

### Methods and Fields

`Java` values have a property that allows them to call Java methods, there are different ways this can be done, but the advised way is to call the method as usual:
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

jString = Java.valueOf("");
// Java methods return Java typed values too
// The isBlank method is a Java method!
jBoolean = jString.isBlank();

if (jBoolean.toArucas()) {
    print("String was blank");
}
```
You are also able to call methods with parameters the same way you would call an Arucas function, however the types of the values must match the method signature, the arguments you pass in should generally be Java typed.

Accessing fields is also similar to Arucas this can be done by just using the dot operator:
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

array = Java.arrayOf();
// 'length' field of Java array type
array.length;
```

### Constructing Java Objects

Now this is great, but what if we want to construct a Java Object? Well we can get the Java class which we can then use to call a construtor. We can get the Java class with the `Java.classOf()` method and passing in the class name as a parameter:

```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

ArrayList = Java.classOf("java.util.ArrayList");

// We can then just construct the ArrayList object
// by calling the class. We do NOT need the new keyword
// here because we are not creating a new Arucas object.
jList = ArrayList();

// Adding Java Strings into ArrayList
jList.add("One"); 
jList.add("Two");
```

As mentioned before Arucas values can be converted to Java values, and you have the ability to construct Java classes, but there are still some cases where Java type values cannot be created. These are primitives, arrays, and lambdas. To remedy this, the Java class provides static methods to create these types of values:
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

Java.intOf(10); // Creates Java int type
Java.floatOf(9.5); // Creates Java float type
Java.charOf("h"); // Creates Java char type
// ...

Java.arrayOf("wow", 7, false); // Creats Object[] with values, arbitrary arguments
Java.intArray(10); // Creats int[] with size passed in
Java.byteArray(10); // Creates byte[] with size passed in
// ...

// Runnables take no args and returns nothing
Java.runnableOf(fun() {
    print("runnable!");
});
// Consumables take 1 arg and returns nothing
Java.consumerOf(fun(arg) {
    print("consumer!: " + arg);
});
// Suppliers take no args and returns something
Java.supplierOf(fun() {
    print("supplier!");
    return false;
});
// Functions take 1 arg and returns something
Java.functionOf(fun(arg) {
    print("function!: " + arg);
    return true;
});
```

### Static Methods and Fields

Now we know how we can construct objects and call their methods in Java, what about static methods and fields? Well, similarly to how we constructed an object if we get the Java class we can simply just call the methods on this object:
```kotlin
import Java from util.Internal;

Integer = Java.classOf("java.lang.Integer");

// Method call...
Integer.parseInt("120");

// Field access...
Integer.MAX_VALUE;

// Field assignment...
// Obviously this won't work, but it's just an example
Integer.MAX_VALUE = Java.intOf(100);
```
