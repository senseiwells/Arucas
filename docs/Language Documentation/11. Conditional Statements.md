## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to branch your code into different scopes based on a boolean. The keywords that are used for conditional statements are `if` and `else`. It works by evaluating an expression, if it evaluates to true then it will run the scope after the `if` statement, otherwise if there is an `else` after the if then it will run that scope instead:
```kotlin
if (true) {
    // This will always be run
    // since true is always true
}

if (false) {
    // This will never run
    // since false is always not true
}
else {
    // This will always run
}
```

Here is a better example:
```kotlin
name = input("What is your name");
if (name == "Sensei") {
    print("Wow that's a very cool name!");
}
else {
    print("That's a cool name but not as cool as Sensei!");
}
```

Shorthand syntax, this syntax applies to most statements that have a scope after it.
This allows you to not use the braces after a statement, but only allows you to have one statement inside of it:
```kotlin
// Skipping the braces
// for one statement
if (true) print("That was true");
else print("This is imposible");
```

This shorthand syntax allows use to easily chain these conditional statements to create `else if`:
```kotlin
if (false) {
    // Do something
}
else if (true) {
    // Do something else
}

// This above is the same as writing:
if (false); // Do something
else {
    if (true) {
        // Do something else
    }
}
// You are just skipping the braces after else
// since if is only one statement
```

Long chains of `else if`s are not recommended, and instead you should take a look at the `switch` statement which has a much nicer syntax than:
```kotlin
name = input("Name?");
if (name == "Alex") {
    // Alex
}
else if (name == "James") {
    // James
}
else if (name == "Xavier") {
    // Xavier
}
else if (name == "Jenny") {
    // Jenny
}
// ...
```
