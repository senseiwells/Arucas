## Errors

Errors are used in a program to indicate that something has gone wrong. Error's allow for a more complex control flow as when an error is thrown it propagates directly out of function calls until the error is either caught or it stops the program.

### Creation

By default there is only one `Error` class which is built-in. This class can be instantiated and can be thrown. To create an error we can simply just call the `Error` class's constructor:

```java
new Error();
```

This creates an empty error, to create an error with a message that will display on the stacktrace we can add a parameter:

```java
new Error("Something went wrong");
```

And lastly if we want to add a value to the error which we can use when the error is caught we can add a last parameter:

```java
new Error("Something went very wrong", [1, 2, 3]);
```

One last thing to mention is that the error class is extendable and when extending it will change the name of the error on the stacktrace:

```
Error: Something went wrong
> File: console, Line: 1, Column: 1, In: throwError::0 
1 | throwError();
  | ^ 
```

Compared to:

```
ChildClassError: Something went very wrong
> File: console, Line: 1, Column: 1, In: throwError::0 
1 | throwChildClassError();
  | ^ 
```

### Throwing 

To throw an error we simply just use the `throw` keyword. You can **only** throw objects that are of the `Error` type, this includes any child classes. If you attempt to throw a non-error type then an error will be thrown:

```kotlin
error = new Error("Something went wrong");
throw error;
```
