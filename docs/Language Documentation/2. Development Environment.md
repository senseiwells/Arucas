## Development Environment

We recommend thhe use of VSCode, with the [Arucas Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arucas.arucas), this provides syntax highlighting for Arucas along with some simple code snippets.

If you are developing for an older version of Arucas, you can use the [Arucas Plugin](https://github.com/Kariaro/ArucasHighlighter/tree/main) designed for IntelliJ by [HardCoded](https://github.com/Kariaro), this highlights your code informing you of errors in your code, and adding nice colours :).

So now that you are able to run Arucas files, what do we put inside? If you have not already, you should take a look at the [Language Syntax](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas/blob/main/docs/Language%20Documentation/3.%20Syntax.md) page briefly, but we will cover everything in detail here.
