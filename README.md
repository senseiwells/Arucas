## What is Arucas?

Arucas is a dynamically typed interpreted language using Kotlin as it's host language.
The language was designed to be easily integrated into other Java programs, and the main purpose of this language was for Minecraft Scripting which can be found in my mod [here](https://github.com/senseiwells/EssentialClient)
The syntax of the language is similar to that of Java, and JavaScript.

A huge thank you to [HardCoded](https://github.com/Kariaro) for helping immensely with this project!
